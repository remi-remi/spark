DO NOT REPLACE THE .ENV WITH ANY .ENV FROM A NEW UPDATE

.env.*.prod are related to your situation and only your.

.env.dev should only be used for local development (only for the maintainer)

if you have a fallback server or a dev server it should use .env.*.prod because .env.*.dev are not compatible with containers 

and sure you can customise your .env, dont forget to reflect db password changes manually.
